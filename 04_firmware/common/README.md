# Common firmware layer

The common layer contains portable firmware modules that can be reused by ESP32, STM32, and future platforms.

## Purpose

```text
common/
    Owns reusable robot logic.
    Does not own MCU startup.
    Does not own pin mapping.
    Does not own RTOS task creation.
    Does not include vendor HAL headers.
```

## Module responsibilities

### interfaces

```text
if_spi
    Defines a generic SPI transfer function.
    Allows common drivers to use SPI without knowing the MCU backend.

if_display_io
    Defines portable command, data, reset, and delay operations for a
    display controller.
    Hides MCU SPI and GPIO details from display drivers.

if_can
    Defines a portable classic CAN frame.
    Hides ESP32 TWAI and future STM32 FDCAN frame types from protocols.
```

### drivers

```text
drv_ism330dhcx
    Portable ISM330DHCX register driver.
    Probes WHO_AM_I.
    Configures ODR and full-scale settings.
    Reads raw temperature, gyro, and accelerometer data.
    Converts raw counts to SI units using the active driver configuration.

drv_ssd1351
    Portable 128 x 128 SSD1351 RGB565 framebuffer driver.
    Owns controller initialization, pixel storage, rectangles, and
    display transfers through if_display_io.
```

### protocols

```text
proto_crsf
    Parses a CRSF byte stream.
    Validates DVB-S2 CRC-8.
    Unpacks all 16 11-bit RC channels.
    Tracks valid-frame, CRC-error, and parse-error counts.

proto_cubemars_ak
    Packs selected CubeMars servo commands into extended CAN frames.
    Decodes periodic servo feedback and fault codes.
    Leaves CAN peripheral ownership to the platform motor task.
```

### estimation

```text
est_imu_mount
    Maps sensor-frame acceleration and gyro data into the robot body frame.
    Body X is robot front.
    Body Y is robot left.
    Body Z is robot up.

est_imu_calibration
    Collects stationary gyro samples.
    Computes gyro bias.
    Applies bias correction to gyro data.

est_attitude
    Provides a generic attitude-estimator API.
    Currently implements a complementary filter.
    Reserves algorithm modes for Madgwick and Kalman filters.
    Supports 6DOF inputs now and 9DOF inputs later.
```

### safety

```text
safety_imu
    Checks whether the IMU data is safe for balance use.
    Checks validity, calibration, attitude validity, timestamp freshness, tilt, and acceleration magnitude.

safety_rc
    Checks RC snapshot validity, freshness, and raw channel range.
    Does not grant whole-system permission to move.

safety_manual_drive
    Checks the supervisor request, RC, selected actuator, CAN state,
    feedback freshness, motor fault, and neutral-stick entry.
    Publishes a bounded manual velocity command and stop state.
```

### control

```text
ctrl_balance_types
    Defines balance_state_t only.
    Does not depend on IMU or safety modules.
```

### ui

```text
ui_rc_input
    Converts configured RC channels into page, vertical, interaction,
    Enter, input-gate, and link-loss events.

ui_state
    Portable locked/browse/interact state machine.
    Owns the current page and selection.

ui_canvas
    Portable RGB565 drawing surface and compact font renderer.

ui_pages
    Renders STATUS, CRSF, IMU, and CAN pages through ui_canvas.
    Displays manual-drive safety status without granting permission.
```

### app

```text
app_imu_types
    Defines imu_snapshot_t.
    This is the shared IMU state published by platform tasks.

app_actuator_types
    Defines the four-slot actuator feedback snapshot, freshness state,
    driver faults, CAN state, and communication counters.

app_manual_drive_types
    Defines the UI request and safety-approved manual-drive snapshot.

app_supervisor_types
    Defines SAFE_IDLE and MANUAL_DRIVE whole-system modes.

app_rc_types
    Defines rc_snapshot_t with all 16 raw CRSF channels, timestamp,
    validity, and communication error counters.

app_balance_state
    Converts imu_snapshot_t and safety_imu_status_t into balance_state_t.
    This keeps control types independent from IMU and safety details.
```

## Dependency direction
