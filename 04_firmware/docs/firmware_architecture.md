# Firmware architecture

The firmware is organized around clear ownership boundaries. Each layer owns one type of responsibility and depends only on lower-level or peer interfaces that are stable.

## Current IMU pipeline

## Current RC pipeline

```text

bsp_crsf_uart_esp32
    |

    v
rc_snapshot_t with all 16 channels

    |
    +--> ui_rc_input
    |       |
    |       v
    |   semantic UI events
    |
    +--> task_supervisor and task_safety manual-drive input path
```

`task_rc` owns the UART and publishes the latest timestamped snapshot.
The protocol parser is portable and contains no ESP-IDF, FreeRTOS, pin,
or board dependencies.

## Current display pipeline

```text
ESP32 SPI3 and control pins
    |
    v
bsp_display_spi_esp32
    |
    v
if_display_io_t
    |
    v
drv_ssd1351
    |
    v
RGB565 framebuffer
    ^
    |
ui_canvas <--- ui_pages
    ^
    |
ui_state <--- ui_rc_input
    ^
    |
RC, IMU, and actuator snapshots
    |
    v
task_ui
```

`task_ui` owns the display. It may read subsystem snapshots and present
status, but it does not own safety state or motion commands. Portable UI
input mapping, browse/interact state, and page rendering remain in
`common/`.

## Current actuator and manual-drive pipeline

```text
Four CubeMars AK40-10 actuator slots
    |
    v
Adafruit TJA1051T/3 CAN Pal
    |
    v
ESP32 TWAI at 1 Mbit/s

    v
bsp_can_esp32
    |
    v
if_can_frame_t
    |
    v
proto_cubemars_ak
    |
    v
task_motor
    |
    v
actuator_snapshot_t
    |
    +--> test_actuator_snapshot
    +--> task_ui
    +--> task_safety

task_ui manual-drive request
    |
    v
task_supervisor mode
    |
    v
safety_manual_drive permission and bounded command
    |
    v
task_motor command freshness check and CAN transmit
```

`task_motor` publishes fresh servo feedback, fault codes, bus state, and
communication counters. It can transmit the bounded servo velocity
command only while a fresh `task_safety` approval is present. It sends
no command automatically at boot.

## Ownership rules

```text
task_imu
    Owns IMU hardware access.
    Publishes the latest IMU snapshot.

task_rc
    Owns CRSF UART access.
    Publishes the latest 16-channel RC snapshot.

task_ui
    Owns the SSD1351 display and static RGB565 framebuffer.
    Reads snapshots, updates the portable UI state, and displays status.

task_motor
    Owns the ESP32 TWAI peripheral and CAN receive queue.
    Publishes feedback for four configurable actuator slots.
    Monitors bus state and requests recovery after bus-off.
    Sends only fresh, safety-approved commands.
    Applies a local zero-command fallback when approval expires.

task_supervisor
    Owns SAFE_IDLE and MANUAL_DRIVE whole-system modes.
    Converts a fresh UI request into an explicit system mode.

task_safety
    Owns manual-drive permission.
    Checks RC freshness and range, CAN state, selected actuator,
    feedback freshness, motor fault, neutral stick, and supervisor mode.
    Publishes the only command accepted by task_motor.

ui_rc_input
    Owns channel mapping, SC input gating, thresholds, hysteresis, and
    input re-arming.

ui_state
    Owns locked/browse/interact behavior, page, selection, and Enter
    events.

ui_pages
    Owns STATUS, CRSF, IMU, and CAN page formatting.
    Displays safety state but does not grant permission to move.

ui_canvas
    Owns portable RGB565 drawing and compact font rendering.

drv_ism330dhcx
    Owns ISM330DHCX register operations and raw-data conversion.

est_imu_mount
    Owns sensor-frame to body-frame mapping.

est_imu_calibration
    Owns gyro bias estimation and correction.

est_attitude
    Owns attitude estimation.

safety_imu
    Owns IMU-level validity and freshness checks.

safety_rc
    Owns RC validity, freshness, and raw channel-range checks.

app_balance_state
    Owns the conversion from IMU and safety status to control-facing balance state.

ctrl_balance_types
    Owns only the control-facing balance state definition.
```

## Planned full robot task flow

```text
Supervisor task
    Owns whole-system mode.
    Coordinates safe idle, calibration, ready, armed, balancing, controlled stop, fault, and estop states.

Safety task
    Owns permission to move.
    Checks IMU, RC link, battery, motor feedback, command freshness, and system mode.

Control task
    Owns desired command calculation.
    Uses balance_state_t and user command inputs.
    Produces desired robot or motor commands.

Motor task
    Owns physical motor communication.
    Sends only safety-approved commands.

UI task
    Owns display and user interaction.
    Sends requests through queues or service interfaces.
    Does not directly enable torque or write motor commands.

Logging task
    Records snapshots, faults, command data, and experiment data.
```

## Data passing rules

```text
Use snapshots for latest state.
Use queues for events that must not be missed.
Use state machines for system mode, safety, UI, calibration, logging, and subsystem behavior.
Use timestamps and validity flags for data freshness.
```

## Build ownership

```text
common/
    Portable source files are compiled into each platform target as needed.

platforms/esp32/main/CMakeLists.txt
    Adds ESP32 files and selected common files to the ESP-IDF component.

platforms/stm32/app/CMakeLists.txt
    Adds user-owned STM32 app files and selected common files to the STM32 target.
```
